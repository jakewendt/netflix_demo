How To ...
	

Use ...

Search for catalog titles
	

catalog/titles returns catalog title URLs (whose format is catalog/titles/12345678) which can be used in subsequent requests, such as queries for title details or requests to add titles to a queue. You use the search API resources as a source of titles that you then use with other API resources.

Use the title expansion parameter expand=value to retrieve title details or links to details inline. The parameter values are title detail categories separated by commas, such as cast and directors. (See Understanding Resources for information on title expansion.)

catalog/titles/autocomplete incorporates automatic completion in the title search. As the user enters a title to search for, lists of search terms matching the partial search text are returned. This allows you to give the user a list of suggested matches for search terms. The user can select from this list or continue typing to narrow the list choices.

Retrieve title details
